	<p>For Part A, I have an object that uses a vertex displacing shader, a textured shader, and a shader that responds to light. I wanted to have the Walt Disney model also be textured, but I could not get both the texture and the light working in tandem.</p>

	<p>In Part B, I wanted Jeff Goldblum to remain sharp as ever, so I applied a sharpening effect. While playing around with values, I discovered I could also brighten him further. He's now sharper and brighter than ever.</p>

	<p>Part C is Conway's Game of Life rendered onto a cube. I'm actually pretty sure I did this completely incorrectly as it's still rendering the texture as if it's to screen space, but in the shape of a rotating cube. That said, I think that looks kinda awesome and way better than it would've if I had just had each side as the same game of life repeated. Also the effect it makes around the edges of the cube is pretty coolio.</p>
